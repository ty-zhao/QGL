This repository uses the MkDocs (v1.1.2) utilities for documentation rendering. The mkdocs-jupyter
plugin must be installed to translate the jupyter notebook examples into html documentation. This can be
installed with "pip install mkdocs-jupyter".

From the repo root directory, "mkdocs --help" shows the options.
"mkdocs build" for example, writes a set of html documents under the ./site subdirectory

(Aside: ./site is NOT currently in the .gitignore file; insertion pending for consistency).
